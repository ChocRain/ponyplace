ponyplace is a 2d pony chatroom powered by node.js and WebSocket.

Setup
=====

1. `cd` into the `server` directory and do `npm install websocket` to get [WebSocket-Node](https://github.com/Worlize/WebSocket-Node) (which itself requires node-gyp, do `sudo npm install -g node-gyp` first) and `npm install keypress` to get the keypress module
2. Run `server.js`
3. Run a web server at the same hostname
